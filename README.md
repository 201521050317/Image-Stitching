Image-Stitching
===============

**NOTICE**

  This doesn't currently work very well at all. However, it could be coerced to work
with a little bit of magic, and it may serve as a good starting point for some other
stitching project.


  Our image stitcher will use GPS information combined with visual attributes to
generate a large map from a series of images. Stitching could be done in realtime or
after a flight once all of the images have been generated. The stitcher will also be 
able to handle images that do not have GPS data associated with them, but the result
may not be stitched correctly.
